## Installation

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## Usage

Start by importing the icon you would like:
```js
import wallet from '@shopware-ag/meteor-icon-kit/icons/regular/wallet.svg';
```

### Dynamic colors

Take this pseudo html:
```html
<span class="icon-example">
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <!--- ... -->
    </svg>
</span>
```

By defining the following class structure in `CSS` you can change the color of the svg dynamically:
```CSS
.icon-example {
  display: block;
  color: green;
  
  svg {
    fill: currentColor;

    path,
    use {
      fill: currentColor;
    }
  }
}
```
